      "description": "**OVERVIEW:**\n\n* **ROLE TITLE**: Senior Python/React Engineer\n* **MAXIMUM RATE**: Around $82/hour. If the candidate is a perfect match for the role, our client might go higher. This rate applies to corporate\\-to\\-corporate or 1099 structures. A W\\-2 structure is possible, but the rate would need to be adjusted to cover employer costs (ask for a quote).\n* **PAYMENT TERMS**: Payments are cut bi\\-weekly with \"Paid when Paid\" terms (meaning we'll pay the same day we receive payment from the end\\-client). Typically, this client pays monthly around NET30\\.\n* **START / END**: ASAP to 05/01/2026 (six months), with high odds of extension.\n* **WORK AUTHORIZATION**: US Citizens or Green Card only (no H1, OPT, GC EAD, etc.)\n* **WORK ARRANGEMENT**:\n\t+ 100% Remote from within the US.\n\t+ Preference given to candidates who are in Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Texas. An ideal candidate will be within commuting distance of the Twin Cities.\n* **CLIENT LOCATION**: Minneapolis, MN\n* **SUBMISSIONS DUE**: 11/27/25 4PM CST\n\n**DETAILS:**\n\n\nThis is an exclusive backfill of a consultant who has been with the end client for 6\\+ years. The team is building and maintaining a customer\\-survey–driven application that ingests survey inputs, feeds them into an internal LLM/AI layer, and uses that data to help answer questions, surface insights, and support future customer interactions. The work is centered around application development, not data engineering or model training \\- the AI/LLM component is already in place, and the engineer will focus on the application that interacts with it.\n\n\nTo succeed here, the engineer must be a **true full\\-stack Python \\+ React developer**, able to build front\\-end features in React and implement backend services in Python/FastAPI. This is similar to a modern C\\#/.NET full\\-stack role \\- owning work from the API and database layer up through the UI, contributing across the full SDLC, and supporting a production system that underpins an AI\\-driven workflow.\n\n\nThis is a hands\\-on development role requiring depth in React, not hobby\\-level front\\-end experience, and strong practical Python engineering skills. It is **pure application development \\- not data, analytics, or ML engineering.**\n\n**Key Responsibilities:**\n\n* Build and maintain full\\-stack application features in Python (FastAPI strongly preferred; Django/Flask acceptable background).\n* Develop and integrate RESTful APIs that support an AI/LLM\\-backed survey\\-processing application.\n* Deliver front\\-end features using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the ability to code live and work through detailed technical problem\\-solving.\n* Handle database responsibilities \\- designing schemas, writing queries, and managing migrations for PostgreSQL/MySQL environments.\n* Write automated tests, participate in code reviews, and ensure clean, maintainable code.\n* Support the full SDLC from design through deployment and production support.\n* Troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and collaborate with stakeholders in a long\\-running, business\\-critical application environment.\n\n**KEY SKILLS:**\n\n* **React**. Candidates must have at least **2–3 years** of professional experience with React. Personal projects are not sufficient.\n* **Python** with **FastAPI** with **1\\-2 projects** using it in a professional setting. Django or Flask experience is nice\\-to\\-have, but not a replacement for that.\n* 4\\-6\\+ years of **full\\-stack** software development experience.\n* Strong background with **REST APIs**.\n* Experience with **PostgreSQL or MySQL** and **ORMs**.\n* Proficient with **Git workflows** and CI/CD pipelines.\n* Solid understanding of **OOP**, testing, debugging, and clean code practices.\n\n**NICE TO HAVE REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n* Familiarity with **LLM\\-based applications**, embeddings, prompt engineering, or AI\\-driven analysis.\n\n**HOW TO APPLY:**\n\n\nIf you are a motivated and organized individual passionate about Information Technology, we would love to hear from you. To apply, please answer our applicant questions and submit your resume detailing your qualifications and relevant experience. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\n***Amplified Sourcing*** ***is an equal opportunity employer and will consider all applicants without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local laws****.*",
